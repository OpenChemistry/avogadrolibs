 * @class Elements elements.h <avogadro/core/elements.h>
 * @brief The Elements class stores basic data about chemical elements.
 *
 * The elements class gives a simple interface to basic data about chemical
 * elements. The data is automatically generated from the Blue Obelisk data
 * repository.
 *
 * The atomic numbers between the symbolic constants CustomElementMin and
 * CustomElementMax are used to represent non-elemental entities, such as
 * particles or structures units from MD simulations. Custom elements names and
 * symbols are returned as name="CustomElement_aa" and symbol="Xaa", where 'aa'
 * is some combination of lowercase letters that is unique to the particular
 * custom element atomic number. For all custom elements, the radii will match
 * Carbon, the color is random (but consistent), and the mass is zero.
