/**
 * \brief This class implements a high resolution timer capable of measuring time intervals with a resolution
 *        of some microseconds
 * \ingroup jkqtptools_debugging
 *
 * \attention Note that this is a MS Windows specific implementation od a high-resolution timer using some of
 * windows' API methods (namely \c QueryPerformanceCounter() and \c QueryPerformanceFrequency() ). So if you want
 * to use this class on non-win32 systems you will have to find a way to implement it for your system!!!
 *
 * \attention Also note that a standard windows system is NOT a real time OS. So do not expect to get a high accuracy
 * when timing operations using this timer. It gives you an accurate time stamp, but it can not guarantee when
 * the code is executed!
 *
 *
 * The timer works very simple:
 *   - you can start the timer with start() which means you set a time=0
 *   - then you can query the time difference to the last call of start() by using getTime().
 * .
 *
 *
 * \par win32 implementation issues:
 * To implement this timer on windows systems I use two API calls from the windows kernel. They are:
 *   - <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms644904.aspx">QueryPerformanceCounter()</a>
 *   - <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms644905.aspx">QueryPerformanceFrequency()</a>
 * .
 * \n
 * The first one is used to read times: In the start() method we simply save the current counter value to a variable.
 * In getTime() we can then again use QueryPerformanceCounter() to get the current counter value and then calculate
 * the difference between these two. Using QueryPerformanceFrequency() we can calculate the time difference in usecs
 * from the counter value difference using:
 *   \f[ \Delta t=\frac{N_{\mbox{now}}-N_{\mbox{start}}}{\mbox{\texttt{QueryPerformanceFrequency()}}}\cdot 10^{6} \f]
