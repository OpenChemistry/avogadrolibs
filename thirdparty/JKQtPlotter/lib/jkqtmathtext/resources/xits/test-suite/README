This is a set of disorganised test file that I dump here occasionally,
don't get fooled by the name of this directory.

Files with .tex extensions are ConTeXt files, they usually have 3 modes,
the default which uses XITS fonts, "modern" which uses Computer Modern
fonts and "cambria" which uses Cambria fonts, this is useful for comparing
the output of the three font families. To run, issue:

$ context foo.tex                # XITS mode
$ context --mode=modern foo.tex  # CM mode
$ context --mode=cambria foo.tex # Cambria mode

Files with .ltx are LaTeX files and can be run with either LuaTeX or
XeTeX using LaTeX format, usually to compare the output of both engines:

$ lualatex foo.ltx # LuaTeX engine
$ xelatex foo.ltx  # XeTeX engine
