\defgroup jkqtfastplotter JKQTFastPlotter: Speed-Optimized Plotter class

	This is an indepent (and fully self-contained) plotter class, which is optimized for drawing speed, rather than
	output quality. It lacks several of the advanced features of JKQTPlotter, but can be used in cases, where fast
	update of plots or real-time plotting is required.

	An example for the usage of this class can be found here: \subpage JKQTFastPlotterTest
