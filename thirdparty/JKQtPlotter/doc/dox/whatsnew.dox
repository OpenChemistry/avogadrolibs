  <li>renamed/breaking change: renamed JKQTPPlotObject->JKQTPGeometricPlotElement and added new base class JKQTPPlotAnnotationElement</li>
  <li>renamed/breaking change: renamed JKQTPColorPaletteStyleAndToolsMixin::setPalette() -> JKQTPColorPaletteStyleAndToolsMixin::setColorPalette()</li>
  <li>removed/breaking change: removed the usage of some deprecated functions and objects (e.g. QMatrix)</li>
  <li>removed/breaking change: removed the overlay elements (derived from JKQTPOverlayElement), which were not very well set up and are more confusing than useful.</li>
  <li>improved/breaking change: geometric objects now use an adaptive drawing algorithm to represent curves (before e.g. ellipses were always separated into a fixed number of line-segments)</li>
  <li>improved/breaking change: geometric elements constructor: removed all styling properties, added setStyle()-functions to replace them. This is necessary to better work with the extended Styling system</li>
  <li>improved: constructors and access functions for several geometric objects (e.g. more constructors, additional functions to retrieve parameters in diferent forms, iterators for polygons, ...)</li>
  <li>improved/breaking change: reworked class hierarchy of parsed function plots and declared several setters as slots.</li>
  <li>improved/breaking change: reworked class hierarchy of bar & impulse charts.</li>
  <li>improved/breaking change: reworked class hierarchy of range charts.</li>
  <li>improved/breaking change: reworked class hierarchy of special line (step) graphs.</li>
  <li>improved/breaking change: reworked class hierarchy of filled line graphs.</li>
  <li>improved/breaking change: reworked class hierarchy of range plot elements (JKQTPVerticalRange and JKQTPHorizontalRange).</li>
  <li>improved/breaking change: reworked class hierarchy of boxplots.</li>
  <li>improved/breaking change: reworked class hierarchy of violin plots.</li>
  <li>improved/breaking change: extended styling system for graphs.</li>
  <li>improved/breaking change: reworked graph Base-Classes (promoted several setters to slots, added Q_PROPERTY- and Q_ENUM-declarations...)</li>
  <li>improved/breaking change: made more functions and function parameters const</li>
  <li>improved/breaking change: image plots now manage CONST-data, not plain pointer arrays... This is OK, since the raw data is never owned nor modified by the plot, only referenced!.</li>
  <li>bugfixed/improved: aspect ratio handling in JKQTPlotter.</li>
  <li>new: switching to semantic versioning ... starting with v4.0.0</li>
  <li>new: Compatibility with Qt 5.15 and Qt6</li>
  <li>new: added support for high-dpi devices (thanks for <a href="https://github.com/jkriege2/JKQtPlotter/pull/55">PR #55: Enable high-dpi support for plots </a> by <a href="https://github.com/akenmorris">user:akenmorris</a>.</li>
  <li>new: added geometric plot objects JKQTPGeoArrow to draw arrows (aka lines with added line-end decorators, also extended JKQTPGeoLine, JKQTPGeoInfiniteLine, JKQTPGeoPolyLines to draw line-end decorator (aka arrows)</li>
  <li>new: all geometric objects can either be drawn as graphic element (i.e. lines are straight line, even on non-linear axes), or as mathematical curve (i.e. on non-linear axes, lines become the appropriate curve representing the linear function, connecting the given start/end-points). The only exceptions are ellipses (and the derived arcs,pies,chords), which are always drawn as mathematical curves</li>
  <li>new: a new graph class JKQTPXYFunctionLineGraph draws parametric 2D curves ( \f$ [x,y] = f(t) \f$ ), see \ref JKQTPlotterEvalCurves for an example</li>
  <li>new: added several new copy/set-functions to JKQTPDatastore</li>
  <li>new: added JKQTPlotter signal, when widget was resized</li>
  <li>new: added JKQTPFilledHorizontalRangeGraph, complementing JKQTPFilledVerticalRangeGraph</li>
</ul>
