A header-only, single-file library for colormaps written in C++11.

## Available Colormaps

### Matplotlib

| Name     | Sample                         |
|:--------:|:------------------------------:|
| Magma    | ![](docs/samples/Magma.png)    |
| Inferno  | ![](docs/samples/Inferno.png)  |
| Plasma   | ![](docs/samples/Plasma.png)   |
| Viridis  | ![](docs/samples/Viridis.png)  |
| Cividis  | ![](docs/samples/Cividis.png)  |

These colormaps are designed to be perceptually uniform (even in black-and-white printing) and friendly to colorblindness. Cividis is specially designed such that it enables as identical interpretation to both those without a CVD and those with red-green colorblindness as possible.

Magma, Inferno, Plasma, Viridis are released under CC0 by Nathaniel J. Smith, Stefan van der Walt, and (in the case of Viridis) Eric Firing: <https://github.com/BIDS/colormap/blob/master/colormaps.py>. Their python code is adapted for the use in C++11.

Cividis is released under CC0 by the authors of PLOS ONE paper (Jamie R. Nu√±ez, Christopher R. Anderton, Ryan S. Renslow): <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0199239>. We incorporated the LUT into C++11.

| Turbo    | ![](docs/samples/Turbo.png)    |

Turbo is developed as an alternative to the Jet colormap by Anton Mikhailov (Google LLC). See [the blog post](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/08/turbo-improved-rainbow-colormap-for.html) for the details. [The original lookup table](https://gist.github.com/mikhailov-work/6a308c20e494d9e0ccc29036b28faa7a) is released under the Apache 2.0 license. We merged it and re-licensed the part under the MIT license for consistency.

| Cubehelix | ![](docs/samples/Cubehelix.png) |

Cubehelix is developed by Dr. Dave Green and is designed for astronomical intensity images. It shows a continuous increase in perceived intensity when shown in color or greyscale. This implementation uses Green's "default" scheme (start: 0.5, rotations: -1.5, hue: 1.0, gamma: 1.0). See [the original publication](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011BASI...39..289G/abstract) for details.

## Dependency

tinycolormap does not have any dependencies except for C++11 standard library.

## Installation

tinycolormap is a header-only library, so you do not need to compile it. You can use it by

- Adding the path to the `include` directory in the cloned tinycolormap repository to your project's include paths, or
- Copying the file `tinycolormap.hpp` to your project (note that tinycolormap consists of only that single file).

If your project is managed by Cmake <https://cmake.org/>, `add_subdirectory` or `ExternalProject_Add` commands are useful as tinycolormap provides `CMakeLists.txt` for this purpose.

## Usage

The core function of this library is
```cpp
inline Color GetColor(double x, ColormapType type);
```
where `x` should be between `0.0` and `1.0` (otherwise, it will be cropped), and `type` is the target colormap type like `Viridis` (default) and `Heat`.

Here is a working code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <tinycolormap.hpp>

int main()
{
  // Define a target value. This value should be in [0, 1]; otherwise, it will be cropped to 0 or 1.
  const double value = 0.5;

  // Get the mapped color. Here, Viridis is specified as the colormap.
  const tinycolormap::Color color = tinycolormap::GetColor(value, tinycolormap::ColormapType::Viridis);

  // Print the RGB values. Each value is in [0, 1].
  std::cout << "r = " << color.r() << ", g = " << color.g() << ", b = " << color.b() << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

### Quantized colors

tinycolormap is also capable of producing quantized colormaps (i.e. the ones that have visible boundaries between colors) based on the user specified number of levels. Below is the example of the quantized Parula colormap using 10 quantization levels:

| Name     | Sample                                  |
|:--------:|:---------------------------------------:|
| Parula   | ![](docs/samples/Parula_10levels.png)   |

Note that the supported range for number of levels is `[1, 255]`.

Here is an example code that uses colormap quantization:
```cpp
int main()
{
  // Define a target value. This value should be in [0, 1]; otherwise, it will be cropped to 0 or 1.
  const double value = 0.5;

  // Define number of levels for the colormap quantization. This value should be in [1, 255]; otherwise, it will be cropped to 1 or 255.
  const unsigned int num_levels = 10;

  // Get the mapped color. Here, Parula is specified as the colormap.
  const tinycolormap::Color color = tinycolormap::GetQuantizedColor(value, num_levels, tinycolormap::ColormapType::Parula);

  // Print the RGB values. Each value is in [0, 1].
  std::cout << "r = " << color.r() << ", g = " << color.g() << ", b = " << color.b() << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

## Options for External Libraries Integration

### Qt5 Support

When `TINYCOLORMAP_WITH_QT5` is defined before including `tinycolormap.hpp`, for example,
```cpp
#define TINYCOLORMAP_WITH_QT5
#include <tinycolormap.hpp>
```
(or `TINYCOLORMAP_WITH_QT5` CMake option is `ON`), this library offers an additional utility function:
```cpp
const QColor color = tinycolormap::GetColor(x).ConvertToQColor();
```

### Eigen Support

When `TINYCOLORMAP_WITH_EIGEN` is defined before including `tinycolormap.hpp`, for example,
```cpp
#define TINYCOLORMAP_WITH_EIGEN
#include <tinycolormap.hpp>
```
(or `TINYCOLORMAP_WITH_EIGEN` CMake option is `ON`), this library offers an additional utility function:
```cpp
const Eigen::Vector3d color = tinycolormap::GetColor(x).ConvertToEigen();
```

###  Qt5 and Eigen Support

When both Qt5 and Eigen are available, this library offers additional utility functions:
```cpp
inline QImage CreateMatrixVisualization(const Eigen::MatrixXd& matrix);
inline void ExportMatrixVisualization(const Eigen::MatrixXd& matrix, const std::string& path);
```

### GLM Support

When `TINYCOLORMAP_WITH_GLM` is defined before including `tinycolormap.hpp`, for example,
```cpp
#define TINYCOLORMAP_WITH_GLM
#include <tinycolormap.hpp>
```
(or `TINYCOLORMAP_WITH_GLM` CMake option is `ON`), this library offers an additional utility function:
```cpp
const glm::vec3 color = tinycolormap::GetColor(x).ConvertToGLM();
```

## Tools (Optional)

This repository includes the following optional tools:

- PNG Exporter: This tool exports all the available colormaps as PNG images.

### Tools Build Instruction

The optional tools are managed by CMake <https://cmake.org/>. They can be built by, for example,
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake [PATH_TO_TINYCOLORMAP] -DTINYCOLORMAP_BUILD_TOOLS=ON
make
```
