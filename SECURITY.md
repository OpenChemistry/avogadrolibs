# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

At the moment, Avogadro2 is in beta release. As such, we can most easily support
security updates on the most recent release and current nightly snapshots.
We will work with distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, FreeBSD, etc.) to provide security
patches for widely used long-term-support OS.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.99.x  | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.98.x  | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.98  | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We currently support private security vulnerability reporting through our
[GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
pages. We will work to verify the security vulnerability within 14 days
and a patch or new release within 30 days of reporting.
