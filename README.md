## Introduction

Avogadro is an advanced molecular editor designed for cross-platform use in
computational chemistry, molecular modeling, bioinformatics, materials science,
and related areas. It offers flexible rendering and a powerful plugin
architecture.

Core features and goals of the Avogadro project include:

* Open source distributed under the liberal 3-clause BSD license
* Cross platform with builds on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows
* Intuitive interface designed to be useful to whole community
* Fast and efficient embracing the latest technologies
* Extensible, making extensive use of a plugin architecture
* Flexible supporting a range of chemical data formats and packages

The code in this repository is a rewrite of Avogadro with source
code split across a
[libraries repository](https://github.com/openchemistry/avogadrolibs)
and an [application repository](https://github.com/openchemistry/avogadroapp).
The new code architecture provides a high-performance rendering engine, modern
code development, and significantly improved speed and stability.

Avogadro 2 is being developed as part of the [Open Chemistry][OpenChemistry]
project by an open community, and was started at [Kitware][Kitware] as
an open source community project. The Avogadro 1.x series currently has more
features, and can be found [here][Avogadro1]. We are actively porting more
features to the Avogadro 2 code base, and making regular releases to get
feedback from the community.

## Installing

We provide nightly binaries built by GitHub actions for:

* [Linux AppImage](https://nightly.link/OpenChemistry/avogadrolibs/workflows/build_cmake/master/Avogadro2.AppImage.zip)
* [MacOS](https://nightly.link/OpenChemistry/avogadrolibs/workflows/build_cmake/master/macOS.dmg.zip)
* [Windows 64-bit](https://nightly.link/OpenChemistry/avogadrolibs/workflows/build_cmake/master/Win64.exe.zip)

If you would like to build from source we recommend that you
follow our [building Open Chemistry][Build] guide that will take care of
building most dependencies.

## Contributing

We welcome *all* kinds of contributions as a community project, from bug
reports, feature suggestions, language translations, Python plugins,
and C++ code development.

Our project uses the standard GitHub pull request process for code review
