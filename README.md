## Introduction

Avogadro is an advanced molecular editor designed for cross-platform use in
computational chemistry, molecular modeling, education, bioinformatics,
materials science, and related areas.
It offers flexible rendering and a powerful plugin architecture.

Core features and goals of the Avogadro project include:

* Open-source, distributed under the liberal 3-clause BSD license
* Cross-platform, with builds on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows
* An intuitive interface designed to be useful to the whole community
* Fast and efficient, embracing the latest technologies
* Extensible, making extensive use of a plugin architecture
* Flexible, supporting a range of chemical data formats and packages

Avogadro 2 began as a rewrite of the original [Avogadro 1.x][Avogadro1], which
is now unsupported.
The successor is faster, better, much more stable, and more featureful.
A final couple of features yet to be ported will be implemented by the time of
the 2.0 release, but in the meantime Avogadro 2 already has
[much new functionality of its own](https://two.avogadro.cc/docs/whats-new-in-avogadro-2/).

Avogadro's codebase is split across a
[libraries repository](https://github.com/openchemistry/avogadrolibs)
and an [application repository](https://github.com/openchemistry/avogadroapp).
The new code architecture provides a high-performance rendering engine, modern
code development, and significantly improved speed and stability.

Avogadro is being developed as part of the [Open Chemistry][OpenChemistry]
project by an open community, which was started at [Kitware][Kitware] as
an open-source community project.
