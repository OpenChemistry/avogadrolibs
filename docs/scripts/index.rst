Script Plugins
==============

Avogadro can be extended easily using Python scripts:

* commands
* input generators
* formats

More script types are anticipated in the future, including:

* force field calculators
* charges / electrostatics
* web databases
* custom colors

Scripts can either be installed manually, or downloaded from GitHub repositories.
