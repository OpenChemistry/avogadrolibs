Contributing Code
==================

If you're interested in contributing code to Avogadro, we recommend
that you understand the `GitHub Flow`_ including `Forking Repositories`_
to make changes with the `Git`_ version control system, and financially
making a `Pull Request`_ for others to review, test, and merge into
the main version of Avogadro.

We have several suggestions as far as coding style and conventions in C++
as well as the need to document your code with comments and Doxygen API
docs (which ultimately become part of this website).
