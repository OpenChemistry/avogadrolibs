Avgoadro is an open community, made better by all of us.

If you're an Avogadro user who wants to give back, a great
place to start is supporting your fellow users on the `Avogadro
Forum`_. Questions of all levels are posted, 
and you may find that there are some for which your experience is very valuable!

If you find a bug or have a feature suggestion, please take a moment
to submit a description to the `GitHub Tracker`_, which helps as an open
database of issues and suggestions as the code is developed. While there are
several different GitHub repositories for the project, we will move
issues around if they better fit a particular component.

For development of Avogadro itself, the `Avogadro Forum`_ has sections for discussing
ideas, planned directions, work in progress, etc. This includes both the C++ libraries
and Python scripts and utilities.
